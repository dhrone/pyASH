Times when system needs to know about the endpoints

AcceptGrant
AWS provides AcceptGrant Token which can be exchanged for user tokens and identity info
Need to persist the refresh token for the user

Discovery
AWS provides user token
Need to provide to AWS a list of endpoints which includes...
  EndpointId
  friendlyName
  description
  manufacturerName
  displayCategories
  cookies (if provided)
  type of device (e.g. dhroneTV) so that the device can inform the capabilities.
    Capabilities are about the properties not the directives.  Directives are inferred by the properties that are supported.
    Capabilities also need to include proactivelyReported and retrievable attributes.
    For Scenes, also supportsDeactivation but not retrievable

Where does the system learn what endpoint's a user has?
Options:
  Hard code into program
  Use a separate registration process (outside pyASH) to record the assignments to a database.  Read database during discovery
    When a new device gets registered to AWS IOT seems a good time for that database assignment

  Program should use a stub function to call for the list of endpoints that are discovered for a particular user.  Perhaps a decorated function within a subclass of Endpoint.
  Thinking to use the Endpoint class as the container to hold discovery data.  Would pass an array of Endpoints to support Discovery routine


Handling directives for supported interfaces
  AWS provides endpointID and a user token
  AWS provides directive for interface (e.g. TurnOn for powerState)
  pyASH needs to know what device type to use to respond to the request

  How does pyASH decide which device type to use for the response?
  Options:
    Use endpointID to look up device details in some repository
      Could be hard coded or from a db
    Infer the endpoint type based upon the requested interface/directive
    Use some encoding in the issued endpointID (e.g. <type>:<id>)

ReportState
  AWS provides endpointID and user token
  pyASH needs to look up thing from endpointID/token, determine the things' status and respond back


Database Structure

Tokens
userID (pk)
tokens dict of the users' token data

Things
uuid (pk) - pyASH generated
endpoints list of endpoint jsons

UUIDlookupEmail
email (pk)
uuid

UUIDlookupUserId
UserId (pk)
uuid

### NEED to BIND UUIDs
